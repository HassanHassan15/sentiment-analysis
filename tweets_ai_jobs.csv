4/4/2025,Immigrants aren't taking your jobs. Robots are.
4/4/2025,"The correct use of AI takes your business to the next level

AI will replace mediocre workers for sure"
4/4/2025,In the past this would be wonderful. I am fearful that the advancement of robots and AI are going to replace the American workers in these factories. All companies are in a race to replace humans with computers and robots. Where will that leave middle income Americans?

4/4/2025,They‚Äôve sold us out. AIM is to replace all of us with cheap low skilled labour workers and AI will do the rest
4/4/2025,Also people have famously been  pretty critical of robots taking humans jobs for decades at this point he‚Äôs just yapping
4/4/2025,"Whoever this Trump #Lutnick guy is, he's basically revealing the deceiver billionaires plan.

Casually mentioning slave labour, low wages, and robots taking over jobs. You've been punked America!"
4/4/2025,Because robots are supposed to be taking the shitty jobs and leaving humans to do the cool creative stuff not taking the creative jobs and leaving humans to do physical labor wtf lol
4/4/2025,Billy dem damn artificial intelligence is taking our god damn jobs gosh darn them robots.
4/4/2025,"Hey 
@grok
, what are the downsides of robots taking over human jobs? What is universal income? What are people's concerns?"
4/4/2025,"Robots taking over jobs can lead to job losses, lower wages, and inequality, hitting less-educated workers hardest. Universal basic income (UBI) is a regular cash payment to all, aiming to ensure basic living standards‚Äîno country fully uses it yet. People worry about job loss"
4/4/2025,"Yes, but they'll be AMERICAN robots taking our jobs!"
4/4/2025,"These Trump administration fools don't seem to be on the same page as you. They want robots to come in & tear down those old buildings in your photo, taking all the remaining jobs with them in the process. You can save face if you stop defending them now."
4/4/2025,When are we going to start deporting the AI robots for taking American jobs that no one wants?
4/4/2025,I don‚Äôt think American companies are going to have millions of robot repair people. The robots will be taking what are now Union protected jobs.
4/4/2025,Why did Lutnick said robots would be taking these jobs? Someone needs to talk before you say things in public
4/4/2025,"The only one taking a simple approach is you.

The future is not in tshirt manufacturing - it‚Äôs in ai, robotics and ai/robotics integrated manufacturing

Those manufacturing jobs that are done for $2/hr overseas are not coming back

And even if they do, it will be robots"

4/4/2025,So now talking about robots taking jobs away from American people these clowns are ridiculous

That'll lead to higher unemployment.

4/4/2025,"Considering India‚Äôs context, isn‚Äôt it better (ethically) to have maid and provide livelihood to them rather than robots taking over their jobs? 

Unless you live in an area where maids are super expensive or unreliable."
4/4/2025,Probably a lot of retail panic that FOMO bought and don‚Äôt really understand what they own. Administration has signaled AI and robotics investment. Lutnick even said the quiet part out loud last night on Fox about robots taking the manufacturing jobs
4/4/2025,"Don't forget

over the private business which will inevitable close down due to these tariffs while walmart and costco buy them out and while elon uses ‚ÄúAI‚Äù to replace the government workers 

Wake up we‚Äôre heading towards a technocratic oligarchy"
4/4/2025,"Nope. That's the con. By the time it's over, they will replace human workers with AI."
4/4/2025,your answer to the trade cost is that ultimately robots will replace human industry jobs taking away even more jobs from the  living and those same Americans will go to technical schools to learn how to program and maintain robotics.. your playing chess with your imaginary friend
4/4/2025,"Can‚Äôt blame losses on automation either. Susan Houseman pointed out how misreading productivity data made people like

4/4/2025,"I was on a board of education 40 years ago. A huge number of our high school graduates could barely read and do basic math. I am pretty sure it's even worse today. They aren't going to be able to fix the robots taking their jobs, I assure you. 

Besides, if 100 robots can replace"
4/4/2025,"isnt that what republicans don‚Äôt want? i‚Äôm just confused yall hate want jobs replaced by other people/robots.

won‚Äôt this create less jobs?"

Fukn over the black man since‚Ä¶."
4/4/2025,"Even if they do bring their manufacturing back to the US, why would they not automate the majority of those jobs since robotics and AI will be taking  on the entirety of most industries anyway? Far cheaper and less of a headache for robots to do the work, and NO HR issues!!"
4/4/2025,"HOLD ON YOU MF, you just said in a tweet before this that ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" are headed to the US. Now you are taking about AI, automation, and robotics. Are you taking about new jobs for robots and computers then? so, it's not about jobs, is it?"
4/4/2025,I refuse to support robots or any electronic devices taking over Human jobs. I never use automatic checkouts. I don;t understand how anyone does when it's pushing people out of work and making the rich richer.
4/4/2025,"If most believe in AI and its future, why do they say that bringing back manufacturing via tariffs will bring back lots of jobs? Isn‚Äôt the trend: AI agents, AI robots, taking out the human in the chain?"
4/4/2025,"It ignores the long-term consequences of purposely slowing the economy, from weakening trade positioning to eroding global trust in US markets. Sounds good as pro forma underwriting, terrible for tomorrow‚Äôs fundamentals.

+ Robots not humans will be taking any manufacturing jobs"
4/4/2025,"Exactly! Small businesses will crumble, workers will be squeezed dry, and AI will replace us while CEOs cash in. They‚Äôre not saving the middle class‚Äîthey‚Äôre erasing it. If we don‚Äôt wake up and fight back, there won‚Äôt be anything left to fight for."
4/4/2025,So... not good for the American worker and families then. Higher tariffs now and you get more robots in the future taking cheap labor jobs yay!
4/4/2025,"So robots taking people‚Äôs jobs 
Electricity cost are higher in the US
Management cost also higher as well as shipping how are consumers benefiting?
Is a made in America sticker worth the loss of jobs and higher prices?"
4/4/2025,"Haha, congratulations MAGA. There will be no jobs for you in Trump's plan. Instead of low-cost Vietnamese workers taking your jobs, robots will take them here in American soil. You won't get them back whatsoever."
4/4/2025,Robots are already taking away millions of jobs that people used to do.
4/4/2025,"Working on a longer-form piece for my outlook on reshoring.

4/4/2025,"We're talking about AI/Robots taking over almost all jobs, there will not be any ""other work"" for people to get."
4/4/2025,These manufacturing jobs are going to be taking humans out of the equation. It will not bring jobs to America. It will all be done by robots.
4/4/2025,"I honestly can't even fathom what you mean by this.  Are you saying it's smart to send the economy reeling and cause massive job loss as companies scramble to drive their valuation back up because AI will replace those jobs?

Doesn't make sense how this could be good for workers."
4/4/2025,"Commerce Secretary

4/4/2025,"Ironically, MAGA guys have been played by Trump. Instead of low-cost Vietnamese workers taking their jobs, robots will take them on American soil. They won't get the jobs back. ""You need to retrain in AI and robotics"" sounds familiar? It did not work with ""Learn to code"""
4/4/2025,"Remember the dock worker strike last year? They were striking because they DIDN‚ÄôT want robots taking their jobs.

Now you‚Äôre saying let‚Äôs bring manufacturing back to the U.S. but not have factory workers, use robots? And a few humans to make repairs occasionally? JFC"
4/4/2025,"Who's going to work in a factory? Making what? They should be more specific ... I thought AI and robots was taking over those jobs. If I was in control we should be building factories that make CPUs, GPUs and robots. We have enough car factories, re-train for the future."
4/4/2025,Just shit posting lol. I do think there is some truth to the idea of robots taking over manufacturing jobs though.
4/4/2025,"One of the saddest things about this horribly misguided attempt to bring more  manufacturing to USA, is it‚Äôs simply too late. In the late 90‚Äôs this could have made sense. These tariffs will wipe out smaller businesses & larger ones will expand use of AI to replace workers."
4/4/2025,"So wait, instead of developing world laborers taking American jobs, he is suggesting robots to do so?"
4/4/2025,Back in 2016 we were warned by the wealth class that if we had a problem with AI and robots taking jobs and turned against the govt we would be exiled to empty towns to live in old abandoned houses cut off from resources. This was a long game at our expense for their benefit.
4/4/2025,Robots taking away so many jobs soon.
4/4/2025,"Add one more : the the so called reshared industry  will still lack the manpower or the skills, don‚Äôt expect the office workers go back to work in factory, it‚Äôs too late . And the robots and AI will soon replace them anyways . And the politicians know it very well"
4/4/2025,You got it boss. When the robots are taking the manufacturing jobs.
4/4/2025,Bloody robots taking our jobs
4/4/2025,That's a different problem.  Do you have an idea on how to prevent robots taking all of our jobs?
4/4/2025,"So before it was the immigrants, who pay taxes, that were ""taking your jobs"", now it will be Elon's robots that will take your jobs."

People are afraid of AI taking jobs but in some cases a pocket calculator is more than enough."
4/4/2025,One fear I have. America exports services. AI is getting better and better. Will AI humans if it is more efficient and cheaper? Unequivocally yes. Ai could destroy US citizen jobs
4/4/2025,"To all the people in this comment section: you are happy with AI because you don't think it will affect you. But it will affect everything and everyone. If we do nothing, it will destroy our jobs. Please reconsider your opinions I'm begging you all."
4/4/2025,"If they destroy education, we won‚Äôt have workers with the skills/ability to maintain the programs that run AI. Trump shouts ‚Äúbringing back jobs‚Äù & MAGA cheers thinking it‚Äôs for them. You will be crop picking on farms."
4/4/2025,"So you‚Äôll take a global depression to destroy jobs around the world to create ROBOT jobs here?  So this isn‚Äôt about American jobs at all!  Your oligarchy overlords don‚Äôt care either, sweatshops in Asia or AI in USA, all the same.  This is just pointless pain."

4/4/2025,"AI won‚Äôt destroy jobs.

It will just make the bosses harder to spot."
4/4/2025,Outside the box theory: the Trump admin knows that AI is going to destroy the job market. It‚Äôs far worse than any of us have been led to believe. Bringing back manufacturing will give people jobs that they won‚Äôt have otherwise.
4/4/2025,"of course not, nobody wants to work but the fact of the matter is AI is gonna destroy all the white collar jobs. So there will be 70 percent less available. Manufacturing is all many uneducated people will have left."
4/4/2025,"Brash Economics on paper is one thing.

4/4/2025,This prediction is not true. AI is not that advanced yet and most corporations are still dysfunctional bureaucratic machines that will take years before they can replace their workers with computers
4/4/2025,Are you considering the impact of the nations that are eliminating tariffs on US imports?  How will AI alter the future of global trade?  How would you position an economy in a world that is surely facing a severe reduction in global jobs?

5/4/2025,That stands no merit bc unemployment is low and no one is taking factory jobs. It‚Äôs an asinine assumption. All he did was give power back to China to develop the robots which will do these jobs

 Markets are down
 Robots are taking jobs
 Allies are walking away
‚Ä¶and Trump‚Äôs back like it‚Äôs a rerun no one asked for.

So let me ask:
What exactly has Trump done this"
6/4/2025,"1000%. Those robots aren't really for mixing cocktails and taking selfies for billionaires. They've been designed to replace all of us who are process workers or on production lines.  No overtime, sick, or holiday pay for robots! Driverless forklifts are common now. Less jobs"
6/4/2025,Still. This has nothing to do with tariffs. AI stealing jobs is a layer on top.
6/4/2025,"A) Its still robots replacing workers, it‚Äôs a net loss of jobs than how they described this imaginary scenario of bringing factory jobs back here.

B) Why are we here then? Why tariffs? Why not just invest in automation for specific industries in the country?"
6/4/2025,"They're taking our jaaawbz!
Porn o edition.

And here I am, farming away in summer with a shovel and hand tools  and in winter operating forklifts etc...really old tech that robots still can't do efficiently.

The jobs the robots took next? Media, porn, journalism, Law?"

6/4/2025,"For those who haven‚Äôt seen my posts from back in the day. Her I go. 
Here is my take. 
Tariffs are all just smoke to cover the real goal. With AI taking off humans are completely getting replaced in some jobs. These new factories will use AI robots. Why build these factories in"
6/4/2025,Wouldn‚Äôt the same argument apply to robots? (We must ‚Äúprotect‚Äù against robots taking our jobs) whereas Elon sees robots as a panacea.
6/4/2025,Textile industry couldn‚Äôt keep up with Union demands so they left the country or lost contracts to China. 3/4 of the jobs that offered that American Dream left and Now Robots are taking spots on the lines. Still need workers but not as many. Global Economy did US in.

6/4/2025,All I said is that your argument that ‚Äòrobots taking garment jobs is bad‚Äô and ‚ÄòAmericans will have to pay $750 for a north face jacket‚Äô are inconsistent. Your political lens is incoherent and I think you know that.
